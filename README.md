# ToDoApp
## ToDo list app:
“ToDo is a list of tasks you need to complete or things that you want to do”. One of the most important reasons to a list is that it will help us to stay organized. When we write all our tasks in a list, they seem more manageable. When we complete the task, it will gives us a sense of progress and achievement when we rushing from one task to the next. More or less it motivates to keep moving forward.

## Benefits of ToDo list :
Here are some of the benefits of todo list app included:
<li>Improve our memory : 
Todo list acts as an external memory aid. It holds a piece of information at a time so we are able to track everything easily as well as it saves our time because at some point we spend much time on memorizing the things to do.</li>
<li>Increase productivity: 
Todo list allows us to prioritize the tasks which are important at first. It means we don’t waste time on tasks which are less important. </li>
<li>Helps with motivation:
Todo list are a great motivational toll because we can use them to clarify our goals. We can divide our long term goal into smaller, more achievable short term goals and helps to boost our confidence.</li>

## Prerequisites for the project:
To develop my todo list app, I have considered some of the things which are required to develop todo list app:
Object Oriented Programming Concepts:
Object-oriented design is an approach for solving problems in object-oriented programming, so before we talk about design principles, we need to get into the coding end of things. It is a programming approach based on the creation of discrete objects that interact with each other. An object is an entity which has both internal data in a particular state, and methods, which are used to interact with other objects.

## Java Programming:
Android applications are developed using the Java language. As of now, that’s really your only option for native applications. Java is a very popular programming language developed by Sun Microsystems. Developed long after C and C++, Java incorporates many of the powerful features of those powerful languages while addressing some of their drawbacks. Still, programming languages are only as powerful as their libraries. Android relies heavily on these Java fundamentals. The Android SDK includes many standard Java libraries (data structure libraries, math libraries, graphics libraries, networking libraries and everything else you could want) as well as special Android libraries that will help you develop awesome Android applications.

## Extensible Markup Language
XML is like a database wich store data for various issue. Mostly we use xml for those data for which security of data, data abstraction etc. are not a common issue.
You can see that in android app development we store information about activity size, layout. etc information in xml file. Here security about this information is not our main concern. We can store password in xml but it is not logical to store secure information in xml.

## Android Studio:
Android is an operating system for mobiles and it is based on Linux kernel. It is primarily designed for smartphones and tablets. Android offers a unified approach to application development for mobile devices. This means that developers only need to develop for Android, and their applications shall be able to run on the several devices that are powered by Android. It is an open-source OS, which means that its source code is available to the developers for free. I have used Android studio 4.0.2 version for my project.
[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw8fr7BRDSARIsAK0Qqr55W4Tb2gm-gcLCQ4ZgX-UD6y8B_HqrucGKaBmmCOhMhCLAG4-zqeUaAtHmEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)

## Features of Android Studio:
<li>Real time coding and bug fixing</li>
<li>It’s developer console is packed with practical and smart features</li>
<li>It gives you direct access to Google services</li>
<li>Provides instant run feature whenever you click run or debug</li>
<li>Has an intelligent code editor</li>
<li>Has a fast and feature-rich emulator</li>
<li>Has code templates and sample Apps</li>
<li>Has extensive tools and frameworks</li>

## Android Virtual Machine
A virtual machine is based on computer architectures to provide functionality of a computer.
The Android Emulator simulates Android devices on our computer so that we can test our application on a variety of devices and Android API levels without needing to have each physical device. The emulator provides almost all of the capabilities of a real Android device. We can simulate incoming phone calls and text messages, specify the location of the device, simulate different network speeds, simulate rotation and other hardware sensors, access the Google Play Store, and much more. Testing our app on the emulator is in some ways faster and easier than doing so on a physical device. For example, we can transfer data faster to the emulator than to a device connected over USB. I have used pixel 3XL API 30 for my project.

## ToDo List Project details:
To-Do List project is an application specially built to keep track of errands or tasks that need to be done. This application will be like a task keeper where the user would be able to enter the tasks that they need to do. Once they are done with their tasks they can also remove them from the list.
<li>We can add the tasks that are to be done in a descriptive way.</li>
<li>We will be able to add as many tasks as you have.</li>
<li>Once the task is completed, we will be able to remove it by clicking on “Task Completed” button.

### User interface components that I have included on my project:
<li>There will be an add task button on the application in which we can add the activities and set the date.</li>
<li>There will be a button “save todo” to save the todo activities for each task.</li>
<li>The tasks that will be added by the users are stored in the list view.</li>
<li>There will be the edit icon to edit the activities as well as delete icon to delete the activities.</li>
<li>There will be a logout button on the top right corner.</li>
